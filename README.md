# JavaFX-Projects
A repository for projects done in Java using JavaFX library, currently contains two projects:
*  a Microscope project
*  a drawing and calculating area project

## Microscope project
allows the user to edit the live footage from either the inbuild camera of the computer, or from the microscope that is connected via USB. This project needs to have an added *s* programme running: it catches the frames from the camera and takes care of the buffer. In the version published here, in place of the live camera footage, there is a placeholder file, that lets the user see the functionalities being applied even without any camera equipment. **The features implemented in this project can act as picture editing features, allowing for simple image edition as well as comparing pictures, overlaying pictures and saving the newly crated images** 



## Polimorphism project
is a presentation of polimorphism in Java. Upon start of the programme, the canvas is filled with different figures, and the areas of each type of figures are calculated. User can regenerate the canvas and get the areas for new figures every time.
