# JavaFX-Projects
A repository for projects done in Java using JavaFX library, currently contains two projects:
*  a Microscope project
*  a drawing and calculating area project

## Microscope project
allows the user to edit the live footage from either the inbuild camera of the computer, or from the microscope that is connected via USB. This project needs to have an added *s* programme running: it catches the frames from the camera and takes care of the buffer. In the version published here, in place of the live camera footage, there is a placeholder file, that lets the user see the functionalities being applied even without any camera equipment. **The features implemented in this project can act as picture editing features, allowing for simple image edition as well as comparing pictures, overlaying pictures and saving the newly crated images**.
Functionalities include:
* changing brightness, saturation, contrast, negative
* zooming in/out
* comparing two images next to each other in Dual Mode
* overlaying another image on top and changing the opacity
* saving the edited image



## Polimorphism project
is a presentation of polimorphism in Java, using different implementation for different geometric figures. Upon start of the programme, the canvas is filled with circles, rectangles and ovals. Then the areas of each type of figure are calculated. User can regenerate the canvas and get the areas for new figures every time. The programme allows to choose the figure for which it calculates the area.
